## Problem #1: "Dice" (0.4%)

In this task, students have to implement a program that simulates tosses of 2 dice thrown a specified number of times. The
program outputs counters for all sums that appeared during throws.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Number of throws: 6000
2: 166
3: 338
4: 475
5: 629
6: 831
7: 1019
8: 843
9: 671
10: 496
11: 361
12: 171
```

## Problem #2: "Number of days in month" (0.4%)

Write a program that reads a month number and a year and prints the number of days in that month.
Implement methods `int getDaysOfMonth(int year, int month)` and `boolean isLeapYear(int year)` to solve this
problem. Use a lookup table to implement this program.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Year: 2004
Month: 2
Number of days: 29
```

## Problem #3: "Reverse" (0.4%)

Read a list of numbers. Load it into an array. Print the array to the screen. Reverse the array. Print the array again.


### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the list of numbers:
3 1 5 6 0

Before:
3 1 5 6 0
After:
0 6 5 1 3
```
