## Problem #1: "Which coordinate is closer" (0.4%)

In this task, students have to write a program that asks for a coordinate (an integer number) and coordinates
of two points (two integer numbers). The program has to find which of these points is closer to the user. In
this program students have to implement a method `int abs(int x)` to solve this task;

### Sample Input and Output

```
Your coordinate: 23
Coordinate of the 1'st point: 1
Coordinate of the 2'nd point: 25
The 2'nd point is closer. The distance is 2.
```

## Problem #2: "Number of days in month" (0.4%)

Write a program that reads a month number and a year and prints the number of days in that month.
Implement methods `int getDaysOfMonth(int year, int month)` and `boolean isLeapYear(int year)` to solve this
problem.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Year: 2004
Month: 2
Number of days: 29
```

## Problem #3: "Stars" (0.4%)

Write a GUI application that creates the following picture. In this program you have to define a method
`void star(int rays, float x, float y, float radius1, float radius2)` and use it to draw 5 different stars.

## Problem #4: "Greatest Common Divisor. Slow version" (0.4%)

Write a program that takes two arbitrary integer numbers and prints their greatest common divisor. It is
necessary to define a method `int gcd(int a, b)` in this program. This method should return the greatest common
divisor of numbers `a` and `b`.

### Sample Input and Output

```
A = 25
B = 10
GCD(25, 10) = 5
```

```
A = 0
B = 0
GCD(0, 0) is not defined.
```

## Problem #5: "Greatest Common Divisor. Euclid’s algorithm" (0.4%)

Solve problem #4 using the Euclid’s algorithm.
