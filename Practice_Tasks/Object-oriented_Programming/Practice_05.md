Object-oriented Programming, Practice #5
========================================

## Developer Tools

* [Eclipse Temurin JDK 17](https://adoptium.net)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Problem #1-5: GUI

In this Practice, you have to create several simple GUI applications based on the provided compiled `jar` files. You can download the `jar` files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cA4Q-u7-t7naxOFsZ7Ho8QSdb_n8rljy?usp=sharing) and run each with the `java -jar <file name>` command from the terminal. Note that you do not have to create `jar` files for your programs.

### Homework

Read Introduction to Java Programming, 12th Edition by Y. Daniel Liang, Chapter 11.

### Expected Repository Structure

When you finish all assignments, your repository should look like this:

```
.
└── lab-05
    ├── lab-05.iml
    └── src
        ├── Problem01.java
        ├── Problem02.java
        ├── Problem03.java
        ├── Problem04.java
        └── Problem05.java
```

If the files with assignments are named differently, you will be penalised.
