List of tasks for the course projects.

## Structured Programming

### Project #1

Implement the following graphical applications. Use the Processing library to
draw 2D primitives on the screen.

Name your files in the src directory `Problem01.java`, `Problem02.java`, ...

The documentation for the Processing library can be found here

Note, that complex shapes in video files are formed from simple 2D primitives.

### Project #2

Implement the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) game (Пятнашки)
with the Processing library. You have to implement keyboard and mouse control in
your game. You will get only half the points for the Project for just
implementing one of the control schemes.

Name your main file in the src directory `Fifteen.java`.

## Object-oriented programming

### Course Project

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4AMtPep.png" width="400">

Implement a simple clone of a famous [2048](https://play2048.co) game with several types of user interface.

#### Part 1 (4 Points)

You have to register on the website https://open.kattis.com using your AUCA Google account and solve the problem [2048](https://open.kattis.com/problems/2048). Keep the solution (that you have submitted on that website) in the file `Problem01.java`. You may have to merge the `Board.java` file first with `Problem01.java` to submit it to Open Kattis. You don't have to do it in the source repository that you will push to us.

#### Part 2 (4 Points)

You have to write a console version of the game. The UI is freeform. Ensure that the basic functionality is present (users can see the rules, the board, provide input, get `won` and `lost` messages) and the UI is user-friendly. Keep the code under the `Problem02.java` file.

#### Part 3 (10 Points)

You have to create a GUI version of the game. The UI is freeform. Ensure that the basic functionality is present (users can play by using the keyboard, get `won` and `lost` messages). Ensure that the UI is user-friendly. Animation is not necessary for this part. Keep the code under the `Problem03.java`.

#### Part 4 (10 Points)

Add animation for your GUI program. The code should still be in `Problem03.java`. The appearance and movement of cells must be animated similarly to the actual 2048 game. The merge animation can be simplified to make the code less complicated.

#### Notes

Don't forget to push all your model and view Java files in the same `src` directory for all tasks.

For all minor requirements, try to follow the work in the class in these videos:
