===================================

## Developer Tools

* [Amazon Corretto JDK 8](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Problem #1: "Absolute Value of Real Number" (0.4%)

The application reads a real number from the standard input and then outputs its absolute value.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter a real number: -123.345
|-123.345| = 123.345
```

```
Enter a real number: 12.4
|12.4| = 12.4
```

## Problem #2: "Even or Odd" (0.4%)

The application reads one integer number from the user and determines whether it is odd or even.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the number: 3
The number 3 is odd.
```

```
Enter the number: 4
The number 4 is even.
```

## Problem #3: "Comparison" (0.4%)

The application reads two integer numbers from the standard input and finds the greatest
value between all of them.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the first number: 20
Enter the second number: 10
The first number 20 is greater than the second number 10.
```

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20
The second number 20 is greater than the first number 10.
```

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 10
Both numbers are equal.
```

## Problem #4: "Leap Year" (0.4%)

The application determines whether a certain year is a leap year.

### Test data:

Leap years:
1796, 1804, 1896, 1904, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008

Common years:
1799, 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, 1805, 1899, 1900, 1901

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the year: 2000
This is a leap year.
```

```
Enter the year: 1800
This is not a leap year.
```

## Problem #5: "Grades" (0.4%)

For a given grade in points (or percent), the application should give all possible alphabetical grades.

Conversion table:

```
90 <= A <= 100
80 <= B < 90
70 <= C < 80
60 <= D < 70
Below 60: F
```

### Sample Input and Output

```
Enter the number of points? 73
Grade: C
```

```
Enter the number of points? 120
120 is not in the permitted range.
```
